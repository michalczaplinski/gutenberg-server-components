## React Server Components in Gutenberg

This repo is an experiment

### Usage

Set the `publicPath` in the `webpack.config.js` to the full path of your WP public directory. I'm using
Local, so my path for example would be:
`http://gutenbergservercomponents.local/wp-content/plugins/gutenberg-server-components/build/`
